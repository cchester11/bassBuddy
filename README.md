# Bass Buddy

An application built for large mouth bass fisherman in the hopes of providing them information to aid their success on the lake.

## Description

Users can log catches, fetch a report of fishing conditions of the day, and scroll through a guide that follows each season and its associated fishing patterns.

## Getting Started

Once design is complete, a username and password will be implemented for use of the app. 

### Dependencies

* Dependencies for the site included express for server and middleware purposes, sequelize to run queries in routes, nodemon for developer purposes in develop branch and mysql2 for connection to the database.
